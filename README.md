# Inspiration ♻️
Call it luck or destiny, our team happened to meet as a result of one of asking the others which bin he should put his plastic bottle in. Despite having grown up in this country, people still struggle to figure out which bin to use especially if no labels are present. We realized that this could be an actual problem, where small actions could lead to such large consequences. Hence, we decided to work with this app.

# What it does ♻️
The main feature our app uses the Google Cloud Vision API to predict labels,
which we then use to predict whether something belongs in the trash, compost or recycle.
It can support multiple users and also has a gamification system built right in.

# How we built it ♻️
This application was built in Android Studio using a Google-Vision Object Recognition API.
